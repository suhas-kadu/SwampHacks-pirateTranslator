## Pirate Translator

### What it does

This website does not requires any kind of signin/signup. User has to enter the text in the dialogue box provided and then hit the Translate button after that, the entered text will be translated into pirate language.

### How I built it

I have html, css, JavaScript and an API for this project. First I developed the frontend using html and css. Then for backend i have used JavaScript. I have integrated the url with the text entered by the user, which will be then translated to banana language after hitting the Translate button. I have added event listener for the translate button and also handled the exceptions.

### What's next for We are Pirates

I'll try to add some animations and also some more endpoints.
